# OrangeHRM-Login-Selenium-Automated-Test
This is an automated testing project to test the login functionality of a webpage. The project serves as a learning experience to develop skills in automated testing, understand the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern, and gain hands-on experience with Selenium and Python.

## Project Overview
This project involves writing automated tests for the OrangeHRM demo website. The tests cover various login scenarios, including valid and invalid login credentials. The project uses the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to organize the code and improve maintainability.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the basics of automated testing with Selenium and Python.
- Implement the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern.
- Write and execute test cases using the `unittest` framework.
- Generate HTML test reports using `HtmlTestRunner`.

## Tools/Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for writing the test scripts.
- **Selenium**: WebDriver used for automating web browser interactions.
- **unittest**: Python's built-in testing framework.
- **HtmlTestRunner**: A test runner that generates HTML reports.
- **OrangeHRM**: The open-source website used for testing.

## Acknowledgements
- **OrangeHRM**: Thanks to the [OrangeHRM demo website](https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/) for providing the testing environment used in this project.
